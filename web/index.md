# Nice build system

This build system has several advantages.

* Automatically tracks build dependencies in a way that is independent
  of programming language.

* Parallel building.

* You are forced to write your configuration in a language of your own
  choice.  (Or conversely, you are not forced to use a language of
  *my* choice, much less a custom-built language that I developed.)

* Integrates with git, to keep you from forgetting to `git add` a file
  that is needed for the build.
