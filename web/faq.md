# Fac Faq

## Why is it called fac?

*Fac* is the Latin imperative form of the verb *facere*, which means
"to do" or "to make."  Thus when you type *fac* you are saying "Do
it!" or "Make it!" which is basically what you mean.

There are a number of English words that derive from *facere*:

* Factory
* Facile or Facilitate
* Manufacture
* Facsimile ("make similar")
* Fact (which originally meant something more like "feat")
* -ify, the suffix that shows up in "clarify", "ossify" or "liquify"
   meaning "to make" or "to become"
